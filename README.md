# Your challenge is to build out this entertainment web application and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

We provide the data in a local data.json file, so use that to populate the content on the first load. If you want to take it up a notch, feel free to build this as a full-stack application!

Your users should be able to:

- Navigate between Home, Movies, TV Series, and Bookmarked Shows pages
- Add/Remove bookmarks from all movies and TV series
- Search for relevant shows on all pages
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Bonus: Build this project as a full-stack application
- Bonus: If you're building a full-stack app, we provide authentication screen (sign-up/login) designs if you'd like to create an auth flow
